FAQs

Do I need to be based in Germany? Do you offer relocation support?

At Wolt, we have a hybrid set-up in our tech hubs and for this position we would expect you to already be based in either Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. We don’t offer relocation support for this specific program so you should be already in one of those countries with a valid work permit.

I want to apply, what happens after I send my application? 

If you are selected for the first round, you will get an invite for the next step by the latest on the following week the application period ends. We will be in touch with each and every candidate who applied regardless of the outcome. As a heads up, the recruitment process includes a home assignment to showcase your skills in practice (the deadline to complete it is 7 days), a technical interview, a meeting with your possible team lead and someone else from the team you’ll be joining. We are aiming to make the final decisions within the October-November time frame.

I'm a student/ fresh graduate. Can I apply? 

This is a full-time and permanent opportunity for engineers with some prior experience in the field. If you have some experience and can work full-time, you can definitely apply. However, a separate entry-level internship program (paid, of course!) will follow in January of 2025, read more here, so stay tuned.

I'm interested in working with Kotlin but I don't have the experience in Kotlin specifically?

Experience in modern Java is highly relevant as well.

I’m interested in backend development. Do I need to have the experience in all the technologies mentioned in that area?

Definitely not! We are looking for backend engineers in two different technology areas: Kotlin and Scala so only experience in one of these is required.

What about frontend, mobile and Python opportunities in this junior programme?

At the moment for this programme we are only looking for software engineers working with Kotlin and Scala. However, please feel free to browse our careers site on www.careers.wolt.com/en where you might find something that suits your tech stack and interests as well!

I’m not based in Helsinki/Berlin/Stockholm, can I still apply?

Unfortunately, for the junior position we’re only considering applicants who are already living in one of the Tech Hub cities mentioned where we do support a hybrid work opportunities.

What is the compensation for these roles? 

The compensation consists of a monthly salary and DoorDash equity. In Germany the monthly salary level is around 4600 - 5800 EUR depending on your level of experience.

When would the start date be?

The start date is flexible and negotiable based on your situation.
