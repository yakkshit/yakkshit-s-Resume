Are you our next Full Stack intern to join a strong team of young professionals? Every day we build great digital products for the customers of our agency and we need more great people onboard. We are now looking for developer interns for fall 2024.

The start date will be according to your institution.



OUR SERVICES
We help our customers every day by building and launching top-notch innovative digital products and services all the way from wireframes to design, development, and user testing – and we need yet another smart brain on board to help our customers fly into the future! Our stack usually looks something like this:

��️ Web: Next.JS + Nest.JS + GCP SQL + Cloud Run + Vercel

⏩ Web (Fast Prototyping): Next.JS + Firebase + Vercel

�� Mobile: React Native + Expo + Firebase



By no means do we expect you to know all of these technologies. All we care about is your openness to learn and deep dive into new technologies! Sidenote: We are usually more oriented toward Front-End than Back-End. Our work is project-based with timelines typically between a couple of weeks to half a year. We are inspired by agile development principles, especially Scrum. Examples of our work can be found at www.kvalifik.dk 

We love working with ambitious companies to turn (sometimes crazy) ideas into reality and make digital innovation happen for NGO’s, startups, and big corporations. A few selected brands include Carlsberg, Veo, Solar, Danica and Mikkeller.

More about who you are: 

You are open-minded, have a positive attitude, and you love working in collaborative teams. We are all part of shaping and maintaining an awesome company culture and we therefore value social engagement and taking initiatives for improvements. 

You can do self-leadership, meaning that you have a high sense of self-awareness, self-honesty, self-knowledge, and self-discipline. We don’t micromanage you, so first and foremost you observe and manage yourself (but of course we guide you). You take responsibility, ask for guidance when needed, and are happy to assist our full-time Full Stack developers when needed. 

Regardless, you can showcase your achievements upon request. We care about raw talent, trustworthiness, and deep passion combined with a great collaborative mentality.



OUR CULTURE AND WHAT WE OFFER
A fun, ambitious, and creative work environment with incredibly talented colleagues and a strong sense of camaraderie.

Work on real life projects, for exciting startups, scaleups, corporates and NGO's.

A workplace with an entrepreneurial culture, where the path from idea to action is small and the possibility of responsibility is great.

A newly renovated office in the heart of Copenhagen K, offering both quiet spaces for focused work and areas to unwind, whether it’s playing foosball, Smash Bros on our Nintendo Switch, or enjoying a cup of barista-quality coffee.

Delicious lunches (with vegetarian and vegan options if desired), a well-stocked snack drawer, beverages, and gourmet coffee.

Friday bars, parties, and social gatherings—we love celebrating a successful project with a bottle of champagne, throwing great parties, and enjoying activities like paddle tennis or ceramics together after work.

6-8 times a year, we set aside a full day where we don’t work on client projects, but instead hold an unconference, focusing on learning and exploring new tools and technologies together.

A dedicated internship mentor

Internship salary corresponding to SU (or unpaid if part of a study programme with an unpaid internship period).
