About the job
�� Founding Engineer - AI ��

���� In-person role in Berlin

�� €70k-€100k base salary + equity package (0.5-2.5%)



Tendara makes it easier for private companies to work with the government. Our AI makes the process of applying for government contracts simpler, reducing the bureaucratic paperwork required.



We recently closed our first funding round from top investors and angels (incl. unicorn founders and operators from companies like DeepMind, McKinsey, and Google) and are now looking for exceptional engineers to join us on our start-up journey!



�� About the role

This role is about owning our AI & Data stack. You will help shape our product and technical direction as one of the first engineers and work closely with the founders.



����‍�� Who you are

You love experimenting with LLMs and agents. RAGs, recommendation engines, document-filling pipelines— these are just some examples of what we do!
You are comfortable building across the entire backend & AI stack. From building evals and experimenting in Jupyter notebooks, to deploying containers and setting up reliable backend services.
You feel comfortable in a start-up environment. You aren’t paralysed by uncertainty and aren’t afraid to experiment. It excites you to get an idea in the morning and make it a reality on the same day.
You want to work with people who aim high, have low egos, and move fast.
You’re an excellent communicator. Both written and verbal.
You are excited to work in person from our office in Berlin. Of course, if you need to work from home sometimes, that’s okay, but we believe that people thrive when they are surrounded by ambitious, talented people!
You ideally have experience with most of the following: Python, FastAPI, LLMs, Jupyter Notebooks, Azure / AWS.
Ideally you have 2+ years of experience shipping products in fast-paced environments.


��️ Some things you will work on

Creating summarisation, RAG, and document extraction pipelines to help understand tender documents.
Help us create a recommendation engine that matches companies with the most relevant public tenders.
Build agents to help scrape and fill out tender documents.
Create reliable, extendable architecture with a modern tech stack. As one of the first engineers, you will play a key role in how we structure our codebase!


�� Why is this a great opportunity?

Be part of a small & ambitious team with real ownership of the product and company.
Experiment with cutting-edge AI and agents. Now is the time to build truly amazing things!
Help us make it easy for companies to work with the government. That’s how roads, schools, and our infrastructure is built, and the process can be a lot better!
We offer competitive salaries and significant equity for early employees.
