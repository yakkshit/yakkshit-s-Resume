The most valuable data in the world - user’s search and social data from Big Tech companies - has just become available!

Our vision is to enable the **hyper-personalized Internet**. An Internet where apps/websites re-render to your unique preferences, and AI agents understand your needs to become truly helpful assistants instead of boring chatbots.

We are making creepy tracking on the Internet obsolete. In the hyper-personalized Internet, users are in control of their digital selves.

Fabric enables each user to create their **digital self** - the most accurate digital representation of their preferences - and to make it accessible to their favourite apps via our user context API. This enables users to get hyper-personalized experiences while being in control of their digital selves.

In just 4 months, we are already working with companies with hundreds of millions of users, and we just raised **$2+ million** from some of the best Silicon Valley investors.

### ⭐️ Our principles ⭐️

- Value talent more than experience**:** We are not looking for experts, we want amazing people that will become the experts in something that does not exist yet.
- Aim to be the best version of yourself**:** We want people who are obsessed with improving themselves and expect the same from the people around them.
- No need to ask for permission**:** You can do whatever you think is best for Fabric, as long as it is within the constraints we have and you can back your decisions with good arguments.
- Own your work**:** You manage your work and set your goal without waiting to be assigned tasks.
- Discipline equals freedom: We are much more biased towards “work” than “life”, but you are free to manage your time as you want as long as you keep delivering at really high standards.
- No “Yes Man”: You give feedback based on what you truly think is best for Fabric, even if it’s the unpopular choice or against someone else’s opinion.
- Disagree often: We strive to have a constant level of positive friction to make sure we keep moving closer to the truth.
