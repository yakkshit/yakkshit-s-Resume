About the job
Dear Future Founder,



Here's one way to change the world: Help small businesses adapt to new technologies. Did you know there are over 20 million SMBs in Europe, which make up 99% of all companies? They drive over half of our economy and are responsible for 2/3 of all jobs.



Yet, it's hard for them to implement new technologies like Generative AI.





The Mission



Our mission is to help European SMB owners to adopt technology and improve their businesses. If they do better, we all do better.



We're looking for a CTO / Technical Co-Founder for our portfolio company Glorya (www.glorya.ai). Glorya provides AI-enabled marketing automation services for small businesses in Germany.





About Us



We are a group of founders, investors, and growth experts led by serial entrepreneur Feliks Eyser, who has a background in SMB tech. Feliks started RegioHelden, a digital marketing platform for SMBs, which he grew to hundreds of employees and exited to a publicly listed company. Since then, he has invested in numerous SMB tech companies like Superchat, Nelly, Quotez, EterniTeam, Truckoo, and - of course - Glorya.





About Glorya.ai 



We are a young, fast-growing AI startup in marketing, helping small businesses become more visible through AI-powered products that reduce costs for running highly relevant ads. Basically, it's an AI-based replacement for a traditional marketing agency. We started the company just a few months ago, launched an MVP, and onboarded the first paying customers. The company is profitable and fast-growing.





The Role



As CTO, you will lead software development, work closely with the founder and investors, develop AI-based products, and recruit the tech team. The role offers high responsibility and significant equity.

Youâ€™re highly driven and resilient, with an upbeat "can-do personality."
You have a thirst for learning and personal growth. You are highly coachable.
You're an experienced full-stack software engineer who has worked in database management, API development, and have Git experience.
You're experienced with no-code/low-code platforms and AI model optimization.
You're proficient in German and English (both a must-have).
