About the job
Our goal: to digitally support people with speech problems. For example adults who have lost their speech after a stroke (aphasia), or children who have difficulties learning language. We want to help them to communicate better in their daily lives.



For the past 10 years, we have been developing scientifically based health applications for speech therapy. So far, we have developed three apps: Our aphasia app is one of the few health apps in Germany that can be prescribed by a doctor as a Digital Health Application (DiGA) and is reimbursed by all statutory health insurance companies. Our articulation app is a serious gaming app for kids and its costs are also covered by 79 health insurance companies. Milus WÃ¶rterreise is our first educational game app and has been on the market since November 2023.
